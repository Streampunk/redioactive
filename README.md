# redioactive
Redioactive is a [reactive streams](https://www.reactive-streams.org/) library for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), designed to work with [Javascript's built-in promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) and [typescript types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html). The motivation for its development is for the processing of media streams at or faster than real time on non-real time computer systems on distribued systems.

Designed for the _async/await with typescript generation_, this library is inspired by [Highland.js](https://caolan.github.io/highland/) and adds support for configurable value buffers at each stage.
